__NOTOC__

==Description==
Displays [http://www.xkcd.com/1190/ XKCD 1190 Time] in a navigable way.

===Details===
get1190data.php checks for a new image and appends it to a file named data.txt. A cronjob is used at [http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190 geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190] to keep it updated. The data.txt file here will be out of date, an updated list of picture files can be found at [http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php?title=1190#Frame_by_Frame_Breakdown Explain XKCD]. If/when this comic ends I'll do a final update for the data.txt file.

The current version of get1190data.php also copies the image to an images folder.

scroll1190.js pulls from the data.txt file and handles all the scrolling, sliding, and playing of the comic.

bitly.php grabs the shortened link from bitlydata.txt if there is one for that frame. Otherwise it makes a new shortened url and adds that to the text file.


===Updates===
====April 28, 2013====
Started keep an update log, just in time too since the comic appears to be ending.

Made up a license file (I'm sure it's full of legal holes) that lets anyone (even the bogus interdimensional knowledge seeking Aliens from Indy 4) use this code for anything.

Created an Interface branch to test new interface options.

Added "Image Difference From Frame" that lets the user see the differences between two frames that are not in sequential order. This feature is also linkable.
 ?frame=890&framediff=217

Made the "Frames with Text" section easier to read.
