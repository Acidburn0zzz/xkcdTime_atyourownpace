==Description==
Displays [http://www.xkcd.com/1190/ XKCD 1190 Time] in a navigable way.


==Features==
===Previous Frame Difference===
Shows the new pixels in green and removed pixels in red when compaired to previous frame.

===Image Difference From Frame===
Same as above, expcet shows difference from a chosen frame.

===Share Links===
The text box below the slide bar allows for linking directly to a frame. The short bitly link only works for a normal frame link.

There is an option to link frame differences.

A couple of examples:

[http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190?frame=890&framediff=217 Shows increase in sealevel from maximum zoom to before fading]
 ?frame=890&framediff=217

[http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190?frame=162&framediff=126 Shows scale difference before and after zoom]
 ?frame=162&framediff=126

===Special Frames===
Most special frames are frames with text. The auto play now pauses for a user specifed amount of time on these frames.

There is a panel below the comic that can be opened to see all the special frames.

This part is updated manually, so some of the latest special frames may not show up.

===Preloading===
[https://github.com/MaPePeR MaPePeR] has outdone himself by adding code that preloads images for quicker playback. Clicking "Preload All" twice will load every image in the comic.
